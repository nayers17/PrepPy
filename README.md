PrepPy
PrepPy is a Python library designed to simplify data preprocessing for machine learning and data science projects. It automates common preprocessing tasks, provides insights into your dataset, and offers easy-to-use methods for handling scaling, encoding, missing values, and outliers.

PrepPy is your go-to library for hassle-free data preparation.

Features
Automated Suggestions: Analyze your dataset and get recommendations for preprocessing steps.
Scaling: Support for StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.
Encoding: Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Handling Missing Values: Fill missing values with mean, median, or mode.
Outlier Detection and Removal:
Detect outliers using Z-score or IQR methods.
Remove outliers iteratively or in a single pass.
Customizable and Extensible: Easily add your own preprocessing steps.
Installation
Install PrepPy using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install PrepPy
Quick Start
Here’s a quick example of how to use PrepPy:

Example
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from PrepPy import Preprocessor, suggest_steps

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "age": [25, 30, 120, 35, 40],
    "income": [50000, 60000, 1000000, 70000, 80000],
    "city": ["NY", "SF", "NY", "LA", "SF"],
})

# Step 1: Get preprocessing suggestions
print("Suggested steps:")
for step in suggest_steps(data):
    print(step)

# Step 2: Preprocess data
preprocessor = Preprocessor(data)
data = preprocessor.handle_missing()
data = preprocessor.scale("income", "minmax")
data = preprocessor.encode("city")
data = preprocessor.remove_outliers("age", method="zscore", threshold=2)

print("\nProcessed Data:")
print(data)
API Reference
Class: Preprocessor
Initialization
python
Copy code
Preprocessor(data: pd.DataFrame)
Initializes the Preprocessor with a pandas DataFrame.

Methods
handle_missing(method: str = "mean"): Handles missing values using the specified method (mean, median, or mode).
scale(column: str, method: str = "standard"): Scales the specified column using the chosen method (standard or minmax).
encode(column: str): Performs one-hot encoding on the specified column.
identify_outliers(column: str, method: str = "zscore", threshold: float = 3): Identifies outliers using Z-score or IQR methods.
remove_outliers(column: str, method: str = "zscore", threshold: float = 3): Removes outliers in a column using Z-score or IQR methods.
remove_outliers_iterative(column: str, method: str = "zscore", threshold: float = 1.5): Iteratively removes outliers until none remain.
Function: suggest_steps(data: pd.DataFrame)
Analyzes the dataset and suggests preprocessing steps based on its structure.

Testing
Run the test suite using pytest:

bash
Copy code
